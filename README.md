## The Challenge:
Using the API from [TheMovieDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction), You must create an app that shows the featured movies in the Theaters, in a list.

When the user touches in a movie, the app must show in a detail screen detailed information about it. You can choose which information should be shown.

## Extra features:

- In the main list of the movies, would be nice if the app could load more movies, as the scroll reaches the bottom section of the current page.
- In the detail screen, would be nice to have an option to play the movie trailer.
- In the main screen, would be nice to have the possibility to search by the movie title.

In the end, a pull request must be created in the Github repo. As soon as you finish, please let us know.
